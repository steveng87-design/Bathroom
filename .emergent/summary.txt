The previous AI engineer meticulously progressed the Bathroom Quote Saver.AI application. Initially, the core task was resolving a deployment discrepancy where an older UI (multi-area) was showing instead of the desired single-form. This was fixed by refactoring  to strictly use the single-form  state. Subsequently, the user requested the multi-area system be restored, which the AI implemented.

Further iterations addressed critical functional gaps: combining multi-area quotes into a single price, adding 'Back to Edit', 'Save Project', and 'Email Quote' buttons, and extensively debugging the Saved Projects functionality. Recurring issues included incorrect dollar value displays, non-functional delete buttons, and incomplete loading of project data. The AI identified and fixed state management conflicts ( vs ), refined save/load logic for comprehensive data persistence across frontend and backend, and resolved a persistent 500 error during deletion.

The trajectory concludes with the user requesting a complete rebuild of the Saved Projects feature to include checkbox-based selection for bulk deletion and to fix the lingering issue of incomplete loading of measurements and tasks. The AI has just begun this rebuild, adding state management for project selection.

<product_requirements>
The application, Bathroom Quote Saver.AI, provides AI-based quotes for bathroom renovations. Key requirements include:
- **Core Quoting**: Input room dimensions, select renovation tasks (demolition, plumbing, etc.), client details, and generate AI-driven cost estimates.
- **UI/UX**: Professional million-dollar app design, expandable sections for detailed sub-tasks, and material quality selectors.
- **Detailed Tasks**: 71 granular sub-tasks across 10 categories, with interactive inputs for quantity, size, material grades, and prime cost items.
- **Area Management**: Support for multiple project areas (e.g., Main Bathroom, Ensuite) with individual data input, calculations, and the ability to combine these into one total project price.
- **Measurements**: Precision inputs in millimeters, calculating and displaying total floor and wall areas in square meters.
- **Project Management**: A side panel for saving, renaming, categorizing, and loading projects. Projects should save and load all input data (client info, measurements, components, task options) and display total quote values. This system needs a rebuild for checkbox-based selection and combined deletion.
- **Quote Actions**: Generate a professional Scope of Works PDF, a Back to Edit feature after quote generation, and Save Project and Email Quote buttons.
- **Cost Adjustment**: Manual adjustment of line item costs for AI learning, with accurate real-time calculations and user-friendly input fields.
- **Maps Integration**: Click-to-navigate functionality for project addresses (if API key provided).

<pending_tasks>
- **Rebuild Saved Projects Feature**: Implement a checkbox-based selection system for saved projects, allowing users to select multiple projects for bulk deletion, and ensuring all previously inputted parameters (measurements, ticked tasks) are fully loaded.
- **Address Autocomplete**: Implement a more robust address autocomplete (requires Google API key from user).
- **Material Quality Selectors**: Implement interactive selectors for all relevant tasks (beyond plastering and tiling).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with a complete overhaul of the Saved Projects feature. The user reported that while the Test Delete button worked (deleting the newest quote), the main delete functionality was still problematic, and critically, loading saved projects failed to restore measurements and selected tasks. The user explicitly requested a rebuild from the ground up, advocating for a tick box or select all system for deleting multiple projects.

The AI engineer has begun this rebuild by implementing **Step 1: Add Selection State Management**.
Specifically, the  file has been modified to introduce a new React state variable:

This state is intended to track which saved projects the user has selected via checkboxes.

The AI engineer then proceeded to **Step 2: Add Selection Helper Functions**. However, in this step, while attempting to add functions like  and , a  was encountered in  at line 1305. This error is currently blocking further progress on the rebuild.
