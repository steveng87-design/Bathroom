The previous AI engineer made significant progress on the Bathroom Quote Saver.AI application. Initially, the focus was on fixing a parsing error in  related to malformed function declarations, which was successfully resolved. Following this, the engineer began a major overhaul of the Saved Projects feature, implementing checkbox-based selection and bulk deletion, alongside debugging the project loading functionality to restore all saved data.

A crucial development was the implementation of a native email client integration for sending quotes, transitioning from a SendGrid-based system due to user preference for device-based email and auto-attachment of dynamically generated Quote Summary and Scope of Works PDFs.

The most recent and complex task involved building a self-learning AI system for cost adjustments. This feature allows the AI to automatically learn from user-modified line item costs, personalizing future quotes. The AI engineer iterated on the user experience, moving from a two-button generate system to a single, intelligent button where learning occurs transparently in the background upon cost adjustments.

Throughout this process, the engineer encountered and resolved numerous frontend issues, including state synchronization problems for measurements (resulting in incorrect area calculations), component selection not updating the state, and form validation blocking quote generation. The latest challenge involves a persistent method not allowed error during quote generation, which has been diagnosed as a silent HTTP 422 validation error caused by a temporary code snippet conflicting with the correct component structure, leading to a silent failure and page reset. The AI is currently investigating this silent failure.

<product_requirements>
The Bathroom Quote Saver.AI app provides AI-driven quotes for bathroom renovations. Key features include: client detail and room dimension input (in mm, converting to mÂ²), 71 granular sub-tasks across 10 categories with interactive inputs for quantities and material grades, multi-area project management for combining quotes, and client-facing quote actions (PDF generation, email quotes). The app should have a million-dollar UI/UX.

Current implementations have focused on:
- **Revamped Saved Projects**: Now supports checkbox-based selection, bulk deletion, and comprehensive loading of all input parameters (client info, measurements, tasks).
- **Native Email Client Integration**: Allows users to send quotes via their device's email client, generating both Quote Summary and Scope of Works PDFs, with options for including detailed breakdowns and automatic attachment via Web Share API (mobile) or download (desktop).
- **AI Self-Learning Cost Adjustment**: A personalized system where the AI learns from user-adjusted line item costs. Upon saving adjustments, the AI fine-tunes its algorithms to provide more accurate, personalized quotes for future projects, adapting to the contractor's specific pricing patterns.
- **PWA Deployment**: The application is configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for installable, native-like experience on mobile devices, including custom icons.

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Quote Generation Failure**: The application is experiencing a persistent silent failure during quote generation, returning to the form instead of displaying results. This is diagnosed as a hidden HTTP 422 validation error due to component structure mismatch in the request payload.
- **Address Autocomplete**: Implement a more robust address autocomplete (requires Google API key from user).
- **Material Quality Selectors**: Implement interactive selectors for all relevant tasks (beyond plastering and tiling).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into debugging a critical and persistent issue where quote generation was failing silently, resetting the page back to the form after displaying a loading state. The user repeatedly reported a method not allowed error, which the AI initially diagnosed as a backend endpoint mismatch and then, through , confirmed to be an HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity error.

This 422 error stems from a component structure mismatch in the frontend's request payload. Specifically, the backend expects a boolean value for each component (e.g., ), while the frontend was mistakenly sending a nested object (e.g., ). The AI had previously fixed this, but the fix seems to have been inadvertently reverted or superseded by other changes, or was conflicting with temporary testing code.

The AI's last actions involved re-examining the component collection logic within the  function in  and identifying a temporary testing code snippet (lines 736-740) that was introducing the incorrect component structure. The AI removed this temporary code to ensure the correct boolean component structure is sent.

The AI is currently investigating why the API call still fails silently and redirects to the form, even though initial debugging showed the loading state and correct request data. The current hypothesis is that despite the fix, the error is still being caught and handled in a way that prevents feedback to the user and resets the UI.
