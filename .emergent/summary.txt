The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Bathroom Quote Saver.AI application from its initial state, implementing significant features and resolving numerous critical bugs. Key achievements include a revamped Saved Projects feature with bulk actions, integration of native email client for quotes with dynamic PDF attachments, and a self-learning AI system for cost adjustments. The engineer also deployed the application as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

A major focus of the recent work involved implementing a comprehensive sidebar navigation, which required extensive refactoring to integrate existing form content and ensure proper state management across different views. Several critical issues were debugged and resolved, such as a persistent silent quote generation failure (HTTP 422), input fields not allowing data entry, saved projects regenerating new quotes instead of loading existing ones, and price inconsistencies between the app and PDFs. The engineer also restored missing subtask dropdowns and implemented a flexible email dialog with breakdown options. The current task is to fix a decimal point formatting issue and add a breakdown option for PDF generation.

<product_requirements>
The Bathroom Quote Saver.AI app provides AI-driven quotes for bathroom renovations, supporting client details, room dimensions (mm to mÂ²), and 71 granular sub-tasks across 10 categories with interactive quantity and material grade inputs. It handles multi-area projects, PDF generation, and email quotes with a million-dollar UI/UX.

**Current implementations:**
-   **Revamped Saved Projects**: Supports checkbox-based selection, bulk deletion, and comprehensive loading of all input parameters.
-   **Native Email Client Integration**: Users can send quotes via their device's email client, generating both Quote Summary and Scope of Works PDFs, with options for including detailed breakdowns.
-   **AI Self-Learning Cost Adjustment**: A personalized system where the AI learns from user-adjusted line item costs for more accurate future quotes.
-   **PWA Deployment**: Configured for an installable, native-like mobile experience with custom icons.
-   **Sidebar Navigation**: Added Home, New Quote, Saved Projects, and Profile sections for better UI/UX.
-   **Flexible PDF/Email Options**: Users can choose to include or exclude detailed cost breakdowns in emails and soon in PDFs.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Cost Adjustment Input Formatting**: Correct the decimal point and formatting in the cost adjustment fields, as they currently show 01800 instead of proper numbers like ,800.
-   **Generate PDF Breakdown Checkbox**: Add a checkbox option to the Generate PDF functionality to allow users to choose whether to include detailed cost breakdowns, similar to the email dialog.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tackling two new issues. The first is a formatting problem within the cost adjustment input fields, where values appear incorrectly (e.g., 01800). This could potentially lead to calculation errors or a poor user experience. The second task involves adding a detailed cost breakdown checkbox to the Generate PDF functionality, mirroring a similar option already implemented for the Email Quote dialog. This ensures consistent control over information presented to clients, allowing users to choose between a total-only or a detailed breakdown in PDFs. The AI engineer has just acknowledged these issues and is starting to investigate and fix the decimal point formatting.
