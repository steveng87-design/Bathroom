# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Tested increasing Framing cost from $2,100 to $3,600 (+$1500), total correctly increased to $32,000. Tested zero cost (Plumbing $5,200 to $0), total correctly decreased to $25,300. Tested mixed adjustments (net -$4,800), total correctly decreased to $25,700. All PDF generation endpoints working with adjusted costs. SUCCESS RATE: 90% (9/10 tests passed). Only legacy /adjust endpoint has validation issues, but main /learn-adjustment endpoint works perfectly. CONCLUSION: Backend cost adjustment calculation is mathematically correct - if user still experiences issues, problem is likely in frontend calculation display or data transmission."

ROOT CAUSE: Frontend getTotalAdjustedCost() function is completely broken - instead of properly summing individual component costs, it's producing wildly incorrect totals.

NEW CALCULATION APPROACH WORKING: ✅ Uses saved project total ($26,440) as baseline, ✅ Calculates only the DIFFERENCE/adjustment from original component values, ✅ Final total = Original total + sum of all adjustments, ✅ Reducing costs now DECREASES total (bug fixed!), ✅ Increasing costs INCREASES total, ✅ Math is perfect: Original Total ± Individual Adjustments.

ROOT CAUSE: AI-powered quote generation produces different results each time - this is expected AI behavior but problematic for saved quotes. SOLUTION IDENTIFIED: ✅ Backend provides complete original quote data in response['quote'] field with exact total_cost and cost_breakdown. ✅ Frontend should display ORIGINAL saved quote data, not regenerate. ✅ Only regenerate if user explicitly requests 'Update Quote'. IMPLEMENTATION: Use quote.total_cost and quote.cost_breakdown from saved data for exact restoration. Use response['request'] only for form field population.

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Backend code had conditional logic that only applied adjusted_total when adjusted_costs was also provided. CRITICAL BUG: Lines 642-662 (proposal PDF) and 704-713 (quote summary PDF) in server.py ignored adjusted_total parameter if no component adjustments were sent. FIX IMPLEMENTED: Modified both PDF endpoints to apply adjusted_total independently of adjusted_costs. VERIFICATION: ✅ Generated test quote ($17,000), ✅ PDF with only adjusted_total ($29,802.077) works correctly, ✅ Both proposal and summary PDFs now use adjusted amounts.
